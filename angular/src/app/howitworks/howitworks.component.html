                "Caption This!" is a website application that aids hearing impaired students in understanding course materials. The website will be an open-source platform where students can upload videos of lectures and students can contribute close-captioning to these videos, where they will then be utilized by their hearing impaired peers.

            <div class="hello">
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Students will be notified through the Disabilities Resource Center (DRC) if there is a student in their class that has a hearing impairment.</li>
                    <li>Once given the professor's permission, students in that class will have the ability to videotape the lecture and upload it onto the web app.</li>
                    <li>Anyone in the community can add closed captions to the video (they can caption the entire 2 hours, or choose to caption only 2 minutes)</li>
                    <li>The closed captions will be flagged for a moderator to review.</li>
                    <li>Once approved, the moderator will indicate that the video has closed captions, and students with disabilities are free to watch the video!</li>
                    <li>After watching the lecture, students will then be able to rate the quality of the closed caption video on a 5-star scale.</li>
                    <li>If a video is rated less than 3 stars, the moderator will flag the video and open the video up for a re-caption.</li>
                    <li>In the event that a lecture does not have closed captioning, a speech-to-text function will be implemented, until it can be replaced with closed captioning.</li>
